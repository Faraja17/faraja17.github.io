## This is my first blog post!

Welcome!  You are reading the very first blog post of Teacher to Techie.  I'm Faraja, an educator with an eclectic set of experiences under her belt, who is quickly approaching retirement!  Through this blog, I plan to discuss my reasons for wanting to retire and my journey on the path to becoming a software engineer.

So I hope that you subscribe and read all about the exciting adventures I encounter along the way!
